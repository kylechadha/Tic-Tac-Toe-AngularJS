General Assembly WDI - Week 2 - Angular Version of Tic Tac Toe

Hi there, this repo is for a multi-player version of Tic Tac Toe. Built with AngularJS & Firebase. Added twist: Moves disappear after 8 seconds, adding a strategic element and some time pressure to the game.

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out @ kyle.chadha [at] gmail.com
